OVERVIEW
============
I started learning programming and web development seriously about a year and a half ago. 
I've created mini-programs for practice that I hope to keep tinkering with. Between my formal 
education (with Academy of Art University) and learning from Khan Academy, Build a Module,
Lynda.com and developer communities, I hope to get better and better. Programming is 
addicting and fun. I love learning it!

For this project I hard coded a portfolio site with html/css/js. I made my own artwork, designed 
all of the pages in Illustrator and designed a quick and dirty logo for myself. This is a huge 
work in progress that I hope to keep tinkering with.
